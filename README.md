# Portfolio Project

This portfolio project was built using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. It showcases my advanced web development skills through four sections:

## 1. About Me
A personal description of me as a full-stack web developer.

## 2. Skills
A display of the skills I have acquired throughout my web development journey.

## 3. Projects
A showcase of the projects I have worked on and what I plan to work on in the future.

## 4. Contact
A section for users to contact me via email.

The focus of this portfolio is on creating clean, responsive, and easy-to-use designs.
